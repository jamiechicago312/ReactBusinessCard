                <p>
                    I'm looking to apply my web development skills into a new role, preferrably in the Web3 space.
                    I am currently working on learning ReactJS to use with my Solidity smart contract knowledge.
                    I also know Node.JS, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Webpack5, and Python.
                    As a veteran music teacher, I am passionate about life long learning.
